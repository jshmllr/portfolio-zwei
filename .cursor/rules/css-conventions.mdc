Use logical properties (e.g., inline-size, block-size) to support internationalization.  

Define CSS custom properties (e.g., --primary-color: #ff6b6b) for theming and easy maintenance.  

Ensure responsive design using media queries, container queries, and fluid typography (e.g., font-size: clamp(16px, 4vw, 24px)).

Use modern DOM apis where necessary.
